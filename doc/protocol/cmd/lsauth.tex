\begin{responses}
  \response{200 MECH}
  One of these lines is returned for every supported authentication
  mechanism. The \param{MECH} parameter is the name of one supported
  authentication mechanism.
  \response{201}
  A 201 response indicates that the daemon supports no authentication
  mechanism. Since it is impossible to do anything meaningfully
  without authenticating, this should never happen, but it could still
  happen e.g. in the case of a configuration error.
