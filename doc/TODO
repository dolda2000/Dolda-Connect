			     Items to do

User-visible features:
 * Implement ADC
 * Implement fetching and displaying of file lists (requires rather
   heavy protocol changes)

Protocol-visible features:
 * Implement full support for TTHL

Enhancements:
 * Implement native HTTP library instead of calling out to wget in
   dolcon (initial work in the `httplib' Git branch)
 * Alternatively, find some good external HTTP library (Curl seems to
   be hard to use with Gtk)

Documentation:
 * Document the protocol (initial work in the `protodoc' Git branch)
 * Document the API.

Code cleanups:
 * Clean up the clients/gtk2/main.c file and split it into multiple
   files
 * Clean up local variables in the library.

Other: See output of "grep -r XXX ."
