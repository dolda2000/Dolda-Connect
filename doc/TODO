			     Items to do

User-visible features:
 * Implement a CLI client. I'm currently not sure what it's supposed
   to actually do that cannot be done with dcruncmd, though.
 * Implement ADC
 * Implement fetching and displaying of file lists (requires rather
   heavy protocol changes)

Protocol-visible features:
 * Implement full support for TTHL
 * Implement some encryption for the UI channel (probably TLS)

Enhancements:
 * Implement real Unicode support instead of using wchar_t.
 * Maybe find some external HTTP library which is better than the
   internal httplib.

Documentation:
 * Document the protocol (initial work in the `protodoc' Git branch)
 * Document the API.

Code cleanups:
 * Clean up local variables in the library.
 * See output of "grep -r XXX ."
