# Allowed users and privileges
# Syntax is "user username [-]privs..."
#  username can be default to match any user that doesn't match the other entries
#  privs can be any of the following:
#   disallow - The only negative permission, which disallows a user from logging in
#   admin    - Involves commands controlling the function of the daemon, such as shutting it down remotely
#   fnetctl  - Allows connecting and disconnecting fnetnodes (or "Hubs")
#   trans    - Allows queuing of transfers
#   transcu  - Allows cancelling of uploads
#   chat     - Allows sending and receiving of chat messages
#   srch     - Allows submitting of search requests
#   all      - Equivalent of specifying all the above permissions, including disallow
#  A minus sign preceding a privilege specification revokes that privilege (or, for "all", revokes all privileges, _including_ "disallow").
#  The privileges are scanned from left to right, so "all -disallow" is not the same as "-disallow all".
#
# By default, if the daemon is not running as root, it will allow the
# user as which it is running, and noone else. If that matches your
# setup, there is no need to add any user directives.
#
# If, on the other hand, you run your daemon as root, use the
# following template and add the users you want with the privileges
# you want.
#user default disallow
#user youruser all -disallow
